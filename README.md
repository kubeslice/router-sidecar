# router-sidecar


* The Slice Router is a network service component that provides a virtual L3 IP routing functionality within a cluster for the Slice overlay network.
* Each slice in a cluster has one slice router with the possibility of a redundant pair option. 
* The Slice Operator manages the lifecycle of a Slice Router by overseeing the deployment, configuration,  continuous monitoring, and management of the Slice Router.
* The Slice Router provides a full mesh network connectivity between the application pods and slice gateway pods in a cluster. 

## Getting Started

[TBD: Add getting started link] 
It is strongly recommended to use a released version.

### Prerequisites

* Docker installed and running in your local machine
* A running [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
* [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed and configured
* Follow the getting started from above, to install [`kubeslice-controller`](https://github.com/kubeslice/kubeslice-controller) and [`worker-operator`](https://github.com/kubeslice/worker-operator)

# Local build and update 

## Latest docker hub image

```console
docker pull aveshasystems/kubeslice-router-sidecar:latest
```

## Setting up your helm repo

If you have not added avesha helm repo yet, add it

```console
helm repo add avesha https://kubeslice.github.io/charts/
```

upgrade the avesha helm repo

```console
helm repo update
```

### Build docker images

1. Clone the latest version of router-sidecar from  the `master` branch.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubeslice/router-sidecar.git
cd router-sidecar
```

2. Adjust `VERSION` variable in the Makefile to change the docker tag to be built.
Image is set as `docker.io/aveshasystems/router-sidecar:$(VERSION)` in the Makefile. Change this if required

```console
make docker-build
```

### Running local image on Kind

1. You can load the router-sidecar docker image into kind cluster

```bash
kind load docker-image my-custom-image:unique-tag --name clustername
```

example:

```console
kind load docker-image aveshasystems/router-sidecar:1.2.1 --name kind
```

2. Check the loaded image in the cluster. Modify node name if required.

```console
docker exec -it <node-name> crictl images
```

example:

```console
docker exec -it kind-control-plane crictl images
```

### Deploy in a cluster

Update chart values file `yourvaluesfile.yaml` that you have previously created.
Refer to [values.yaml](https://github.com/kubeslice/charts/blob/master/kubeslice-worker/values.yaml) to create `yourvaluesfiel.yaml` and update the routerSidecar image subsection to use the local image.

From the sample , 

```
routerSidecar:
  image: docker.io/aveshasystems/kubeslice-router-sidecar
  tag: 0.1.0
```

Change it to ,

```
routerSidecar:
  image: <my-custom-image>
  tag: <unique-tag>
```

Deploy the updated chart

```console
make chart-deploy VALUESFILE=yourvaluesfile.yaml
```

### Verify the router-sidecar pods are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kubeslice-system | grep vl3-slice-* 
```
