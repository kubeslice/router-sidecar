# router-sidecar

* The Slice Router is a network service component that provides a virtual L3 IP routing functionality within a cluster for the Slice overlay network.
* Each slice in a cluster has one slice router with the possibility of a redundant pair option. 
* The Slice Operator manages the lifecycle of a Slice Router by overseeing the deployment, configuration,  continuous monitoring, and management of the Slice Router.
* The Slice Router provides a full mesh network connectivity between the application pods and slice gateway pods in a cluster.
